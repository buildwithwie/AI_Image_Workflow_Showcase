# User Flow Overview — AI Image Generation

This document outlines the typical end-to-end user journey inside an AI image-generation platform.  
It demonstrates how a TPM maps user behavior into clear stages that align with engineering, UX, and product planning.

---

# 1. Entry Point — User Opens the Generate Page
**Purpose:**  
User lands on the main interface where prompts, model options, and generation settings are visible.

**User actions:**  
- View model presets  
- Browse recent images  
- Check default settings  

**TPM responsibilities:**  
- Ensure UI clarity  
- Validate loading state speed  
- Coordinate UX improvements based on user stats

---

# 2. Prompt Creation & Configuration
**Purpose:**  
User composes input text and selects parameters.

**User actions:**  
- Enter prompt text  
- Choose a model (Leonardo XL, photo-real, anime, etc.)  
- Adjust size, output count, sampler, guidance scale  
- Add negative prompts  
- (Optional) Upload image for Image-to-Image

**TPM responsibilities:**  
- Ensure settings map correctly to backend parameters  
- Identify confusing UI elements  
- Align UX with engineering capabilities

---

# 3. Image Generation Request Sent
**Purpose:**  
Prompt is submitted to backend.

**User actions:**  
- Click “Generate”  
- Wait for progress indicators  
- Possibly cancel generation  

**TPM responsibilities:**  
- Track latency and compute spikes  
- Work with infra on performance KPIs  
- Ensure retry/fallback mechanisms exist

---

# 4. Image Processing & Model Inference
(Backend/engineering stage — not user-visible)

**Actions happening in pipeline:**  
- Embedding generation  
- Sampling  
- Model inference  
- Post-processing (upscale, fix faces, de-noise)  
- Safety filtering  
- Save output + metadata

**TPM responsibilities:**  
- Make sure each pipeline stage logs errors clearly  
- Ensure cross-team visibility (UI, engineering, QA)

---

# 5. Image Results Delivered to UI
**Purpose:**  
User sees the generated images.

**User actions:**  
- View batch results  
- Click to open full image  
- Inspect details  
- Check variations or regenerate  

**TPM responsibilities:**  
- Ensure UI loads results smoothly  
- Validate consistency between settings & output  
- Ensure metadata is visible or stored

---

# 6. Refinement Options
**Purpose:**  
Allow user to iterate on outputs.

**User actions:**  
- Generate variations  
- Edit prompt and regenerate  
- Upscale or enhance  
- Erase/replace tool  
- Download selected images

**TPM responsibilities:**  
- Define refinement flow usability  
- Work with UX on discoverability  
- Ensure engineering supports multi-step workflows

---

# 7. Feedback Loop & Tracking
**Purpose:**  
Capture user satisfaction and behavior analytics.

**User actions:**  
- Rate image quality  
- Provide feedback  
- Save to gallery  
- Share or export  

**TPM responsibilities:**  
- Define what events get tracked  
- Align with product on KPIs (CTR, refine usage, model preference)  
- Ensure error analytics captured correctly

---

# Summary
This user flow demonstrates:

- Understanding of how typical AI image platforms operate  
- Ability to map user intent → UI → backend workflows  
- Awareness of TPM touchpoints (UX, engineering, product, QA)  
- Knowledge of pipeline dependencies and performance impacts  

This supports cross-functional planning for AI-driven features.
