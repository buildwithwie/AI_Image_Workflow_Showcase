# Sample Prompts and Expected Outputs

This document contains example prompts, expected behaviors, validation notes, and typical issues observed during AI image-generation workflows. It is designed to simulate how a Technical Project Manager would support prompt evaluation, QA, and iteration cycles for enterprise clients.

# 1. Example Prompt Set — Brand Style Consistency

## Prompt A
**Prompt:**  
“Professional product shot of a matte black water bottle on a clean white background, soft shadows, studio lighting, 50mm lens, minimalistic style.”

**Expected Output:**  
- Bottle centered, upright  
- No reflections or fingerprints  
- Matte texture preserved  
- Soft shadow directly beneath object  
- Background pure white (#FFFFFF)  
- No props or extra elements  

**Validation Notes:**  
- Check for plastic-looking texture → reject if glossy  
- Ensure no label hallucinations  
- Background must be uniform (no gradient unless requested)  
- Brand style must match reference set  

**Common Issues:**  
- Over-sharpening around edges  
- Artifact on cap area  
- Slight gray banding on background

# 2. Example Prompt Set — Human Subjects

## Prompt B  
**Prompt:**  
“Portrait of a young adult wearing casual business attire, natural light, smiling confidently, diverse representation, clean background.”

**Expected Output:**  
- Symmetrical facial features  
- No distorted fingers or hands  
- Clothing consistent and not melted  
- No extra limbs, duplicate earrings, or blurred glasses  
- Friendly expression aligned with brand tone  

**Validation Notes:**  
- Must pass enterprise safety filters  
- Expression must look natural, not uncanny  
- Clothing must remain professional and non-offensive  

**Common Issues:**  
- Extra teeth or warped jawline  
- Asymmetrical eyes  
- Distorted hand when included in frame  
- Subtle watermark-like patterns

# 3. Example Prompt Set — Scene / Environment

## Prompt C  
**Prompt:**  
“Modern kitchen interior, bright natural lighting, neutral color palette, clean surfaces, high-end minimalist design.”

**Expected Output:**  
- No unrealistic or floating objects  
- Straight and aligned lines in cabinets/counters  
- No brand logos unless provided  
- Lighting consistent with room size  
- Materials realistic (marble, wood, metal)  

**Validation Notes:**  
- Reject if perspective warped  
- Reject if objects appear duplicated  
- Color palette must match sample (whites, grays, light wood tones)  

**Common Issues:**  
- Crooked cabinet lines  
- Distorted tiles  
- Unrealistic reflections

# 4. Example Prompt Set — Stylized / Artistic

## Prompt D  
**Prompt:**  
“Digital illustration of a whimsical forest creature, Studio Ghibli style, warm color palette, soft lighting, highly expressive.”

**Expected Output:**  
- Soft brush-like textures  
- Consistent color palette (warm greens/yellows)  
- Eyes expressive and non-creepy  
- Smooth edges, no pixelation  

**Validation Notes:**  
- Check style consistency across multiple outputs  
- Ensure creature not too similar to existing copyrighted characters  
- Avoid overly sharp or realistic rendering  

**Common Issues:**  
- Overly realistic skin textures → mismatched style  
- Inconsistent proportions  
- Too close to specific Ghibli characters (IP risk)

# 5. Prompt Iteration Workflow

A typical iteration cycle includes:

## 5.1 Initial Prompt
“Outdoor running shoe on rocky terrain, dynamic angle, dramatic lighting.”

Results: Good silhouette, poor texture detail, background too busy.

## 5.2 Refined Prompt
“Outdoor running shoe, close-up angle, sharp texture detail, controlled background bokeh, dramatic but soft directional lighting.”

Results: Better texture clarity, cleaner background.

## 5.3 Final Prompt
“Close-up product shot of an outdoor running shoe placed on subtle rocky surface, crisp texture detail, soft directional lighting, shallow depth of field, minimalist background.”

**Final Output Criteria:**
- Subject fully in frame  
- Texture sharp, materials realistic  
- No debris or random objects  
- Background not distracting  

This shows TPM understanding of prompt refinement → expected at Leonardo.

# 6. Output Metadata Template (Used in QA + Engineering Sync)
model: leonardo-xl-v2
sampler: dpmpp_2m
steps: 30
seed: 128374
resolution: 1024x1024
negative_prompt: “low quality, artifacts, watermark, distorted anatomy”
latency: 8.4s

# 7. Output Rejection Examples

| Issue Type | Description | Reason for Rejection |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Anatomy defect | Warped hands/fingers | Fails visual QA |
| Artifact | Random shapes behind subject | Not brand-safe |
| Wrong style | Too realistic/too cartoonish | Style mismatch |
| Unstable texture | Over-smoothed surface | Fails quality check |
| IP-like element | Resembles a known character | Compliance issue |
