# AI Image Workflow Showcase  
A simple, structured technical project demonstrating my ability as a Technical Project Manager to analyse AI-driven image-generation workflows, document pipelines, identify dependencies, and outline cross-team execution steps.

This mini-project is designed as a preparation exercise for working with Leonardo.Ai’s Enterprise Squad, where TPMs coordinate between engineering, design, and product teams to deliver AI-powered features.

## 🔍 Purpose of This Project  
This repository exists to demonstrate:

1. Understanding of AI image-generation concepts  
2. Ability to break down a technical workflow into clear phases  
3. Skills in documentation, clarity, and cross-team communication  
4. Practical readiness to support generative AI feature delivery  
5. Familiarity with tools used in Stable Diffusion, Automatic1111, and ComfyUI

## 🧠 What This Workflow Represents  
It simulates how an Enterprise TPM would:

- Receive a customer request  
- Translate ambiguous needs into structured requirements  
- Define technical pipeline stages  
- Identify blockers, risks, and dependencies  
- Coordinate QA and UX review  
- Prepare delivery documentation  
- Work with engineering on testable outputs

This repository is created to support my application for roles involving AI workflows, technical project coordination, and generative AI delivery.

**How to use this repo in interviews:** open `workflow_overview.md` first, then show `pipeline_breakdown.md` and `sample_prompts_and_outputs.md` to demonstrate TPM thinking and prompt/QA literacy.
