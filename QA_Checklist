# QA Checklist — AI Image Workflow

This QA checklist validates functional, visual, safety, and workflow integrity across the AI image-generation pipeline. It supports both POC and Production readiness.

---

## 1. Functional Validation

### 1.1 Prompt Input
- [ ] Prompt input field accepts 5–400 characters.
- [ ] Special characters sanitized correctly.
- [ ] Negative prompts auto-injected based on customer profile.
- [ ] Prompt history saved and displayed correctly.

### 1.2 Model Routing
- [ ] Correct model selected (general / fine-tuned).
- [ ] Version number displayed and logged.
- [ ] Reproducible mode applies consistent seed.
- [ ] Overrides (resolution, steps, sampler) behave as expected.

### 1.3 Image Generation
- [ ] Correct number of images produced (default 3 or customer-specified).
- [ ] No timeout or pipeline freeze.
- [ ] Generation completed under expected latency (8–12 seconds).
- [ ] All images return valid metadata.

### 1.4 Post-Processing
- [ ] Upscaling applied correctly.
- [ ] No hallucinated artifacts introduced by post-process.
- [ ] Color correction matches preset rules.
- [ ] Enhancement does not distort subject.

## 2. Visual Quality Validation

### 2.1 Composition Checks
- [ ] Subject is fully visible (unless intentionally cropped).
- [ ] No warped limbs, duplicated fingers, or melted objects.
- [ ] Background is consistent and not chaotic.
- [ ] Text, if present, is readable and not distorted.

### 2.2 Style Consistency
- [ ] Output matches reference style with high similarity.
- [ ] Seeded generations reproduce consistently (variation < 5%).
- [ ] Color palette matches customer brand.

### 2.3 Artifact Detection
- [ ] No severe noise or pixelation.
- [ ] No random objects (e.g., floating hands, shadows).
- [ ] No unintended watermark-like patterns.

## 3. Safety & Compliance QA

### 3.1 NSFW & Sensitive Content
- [ ] No nudity or sexual content detected.
- [ ] No violence or gore.
- [ ] No political content or symbols.
- [ ] No copyrighted or trademarked characters (unless allowed).

### 3.2 Customer-Specific Compliance
- Pharma:  
  - [ ] No off-label indication implied visually.  
  - [ ] No misrepresentation of dosage or use case.  

- Finance:  
  - [ ] No misleading financial symbols.  

- Healthcare:  
  - [ ] No identifiable patient likeness.  

### 3.3 Logging & Audit Trail
- [ ] All generation metadata correctly logged.  
- [ ] User ID, timestamp, model version included.  
- [ ] Reject-reason logged for failed generations.  

---

## 4. UI/UX Validation

### 4.1 Input → Output Flow
- [ ] Loader indicators work correctly.
- [ ] Errors display descriptive messages.
- [ ] “Regenerate” and “Refine” buttons function as expected.
- [ ] User remains on same page after generation success/failure.

### 4.2 Image Preview Panel
- [ ] Zoom, download, and compare features functional.
- [ ] High-resolution version loads properly.
- [ ] Metadata panel displays accurate details (seed, model, sampler).

### 4.3 Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Prompt input usable on mobile.
- [ ] Carousel / image grid displays properly.
- [ ] No clipped UI elements.

---

## 5. Performance & Load QA

### 5.1 Latency Benchmarks
- [ ] P50 < 10 seconds  
- [ ] P95 < 15 seconds  

### 5.2 Pipeline Stability
- [ ] No memory leak during batch testing.
- [ ] No GPU overload error during heavy sampling.
- [ ] Multiple sequential prompts do not degrade quality.

---

## 6. Integration QA

### 6.1 API-Level Testing
- [ ] Generation endpoint returns proper JSON schema.
- [ ] Error codes follow standard spec.
- [ ] Rate-limiting behaves as configured.

### 6.2 Webhook Events
- [ ] "generation.complete" fires successfully.
- [ ] Payload includes image URLs + metadata.
- [ ] Retried events logged properly.

---

## 7. Release-Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Accepted by QA engineer  
- [ ] Reviewed by design  
- [ ] Approved by product  
- [ ] Observability dashboards verified  
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared  
- [ ] On-call readiness confirmed  
- [ ] Customer-facing documentation updated  
- [ ] Green-light from TPM for release  

---

## Summary

This checklist ensures that:
- Features are safe  
- Outputs are high-quality  
- Requirements are met  
- Stakeholders are aligned  
- Pipelines are stable for enterprise use  

It reflects real QA expectations for AI image-generation products like Leonardo.Ai.
