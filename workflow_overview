# Workflow Overview — AI Image Workflow Showcase

## 1. High-level summary
This document summarises a typical Enterprise-level AI image-generation feature delivery that a Technical Project Manager would coordinate. It focuses on converting a high-level customer need (e.g., “generate brand-consistent marketing imagery at scale”) into a reliable, testable delivery pipeline, with clear stakeholder roles, success metrics, risks and a pragmatic 30–60–90 day roadmap.

---

## 2. Goals
- Translate ambiguous business requirements into actionable deliverables and acceptance criteria.  
- Define a stable image-generation pipeline (prompt → model → sampling → post-process → QA → delivery).  
- Reduce time-to-first-usable-image for clients to under 48 hours during POC.  
- Ensure outputs meet brand safety, quality, and consistency thresholds.  
- Provide reproducible runbooks and handover docs for engineering, design, and customer success.

---

## 3. Scope (what this repo/demo covers)
Included:
- Pipeline stages and responsibilities (engineering, design, QA, product)
- Example prompts, minimal validation checks, and QA checklist
- Acceptance criteria for POC and production readiness
- High-level risk register and mitigations
- 30/60/90-day execution plan for a POC → pilot → production rollout

Excluded:
- Model training or custom model fine-tuning (engineering level)  
- Production infra IaC (this repo documents orchestration and handoffs only)

---

## 4. Primary stakeholders & responsibilities
- **Enterprise TPM (you)** — project plan, stakeholder coordination, acceptance sign-off.  
- **Product Manager** — success metrics, scope decisions, prioritisation.  
- **Engineering** — pipeline integration (Automatic1111 / ComfyUI or API), infra, observability.  
- **Design / Creative Lead** — prompt design patterns, visual QA, UX for end-users.  
- **QA / Content Safety** — policy checks, visual artifacts, edge-case testing.  
- **Customer Success / PM (client)** — business validation, prioritisation of visual styles.  
- **Legal / Compliance** — content-safety policy sign-off (where required).

---

## 5. Key inputs & outputs
**Inputs**
- Business brief or user story (target style, use-case, constraints)  
- Brand guidelines (color, composition, forbidden content)  
- Example reference images (if available)  
- Initial compute budget and latency SLAs

**Outputs**
- Working POC pipeline that generates validated images  
- QA report with sample outputs & metrics  
- Runbook: prompt templates, sampling settings, failure modes  
- Acceptance sign-off document and product roadmap recommendation

---

## 6. High-level pipeline stages
1. **Discovery & Acceptance** — clarify scope, define success metrics.  
2. **Prompt Design & UX** — create prompt templates and UI/UX for preview.  
3. **Integration & Infra** — connect model (local Automatic1111 / ComfyUI or API), enable reproducible runs.  
4. **Sampling & Post-process** — sampling strategy, upscaling, artifact removal.  
5. **Validation & QA** — automated checks + human review against brand rules.  
6. **Pilot with Client** — gather feedback, measure NPS/quality.  
7. **Handover & Runbook** — docs, monitoring, cost controls, and scale plan.

---

## 7. Success metrics (example)
- POC: >70% of generated images pass brand QA on first review.  
- Time-to-first-usable-image: <48 hours from brief to deliverable.  
- Consistency: variance of style parameters within 10% across 10 seed runs.  
- Safety: 0 policy-violating images in an initial sample of 200.

---

## 8. Major risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** Model outputs inconsistent with brand.  
  **Mitigation:** Iterative prompt engineering, reference-anchoring, human-in-loop review.
- **Risk:** Unexpected compute cost spikes.  
  **Mitigation:** Sampling budget limits, cost-aware presets, monitoring alerts.
- **Risk:** Content-safety or legal exposure.  
  **Mitigation:** Pre-flight content filter, legal sign-off, conservative defaults.
- **Risk:** Long lead time for client feedback.  
  **Mitigation:** Rapid demo iterations, asynchronous review artifacts for stakeholders.

---

## 9. 30 / 60 / 90 day roadmap (POC → Pilot → Production recommendation)
- **Day 0–30 (POC):** Clarify brief, produce first 3 prompt families, deliver demo outputs, capture QA metrics.  
- **Day 31–60 (Pilot):** Integrate client feedback, add automated QA checks, measure performance & cost, define SLOs.  
- **Day 61–90 (Production readiness):** Harden pipeline, add monitoring & alerts, complete runbooks, legal/compliance sign-offs, agree rollout plan.

---

## 10. Next immediate actions (TPM checklist)
1. Confirm core stakeholder list and cadence (weekly engineering sync, bi-weekly demo).  
2. Lock acceptance criteria and initial brand references.  
3. Allocate a single engineering owner and design owner for the POC.  
4. Schedule first demo at Day 7 with sample prompts and baseline metrics.  
5. Create `pipeline_breakdown.md` and `qa_checklist.md` (next files to author).

---

## 11. Notes & assumptions
- This repo is intentionally non-code: the goal is to show TPM thinking and practical execution readiness for AI feature delivery.  
- Assumes access to a Stable Diffusion environment (Automatic1111 / ComfyUI) or equivalent API for quick POC.
