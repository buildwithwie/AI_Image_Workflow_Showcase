# Acceptance Criteria — AI Image Workflow Feature Delivery  
This document outlines measurable, testable acceptance criteria for AI image-generation workflows used in Enterprise environments. These criteria help Engineering, Design, QA, and Product agree on what constitutes a “successful” output and a production-ready release.

---

## ✅ 1. Functional Acceptance Criteria

### **1.1 Prompt Processing**
- The system must accept user prompts between 5–400 characters.
- Inputs must be validated and normalized (remove special characters, unsupported tokens).
- Brand-blocked or restricted keywords must trigger a Soft Fail message.
- Negative prompts must be auto-applied based on customer preset.

### **1.2 Model Selection & Configuration**
- The correct model (general vs fine-tuned) must be selected based on customer profile.
- Guidance scale, sampling steps, and resolution must follow preset defaults unless manually overridden.
- A consistent seed must be applied if “reproducible mode” is enabled.

### **1.3 Image Generation**
- At least **3 images per request** must be generated unless specified otherwise.
- Images must be generated within **8–12 seconds** under normal load.
- Outputs must meet the minimum resolution requirement (e.g., 1024×1024 or customer-defined).

### **1.4 Post-Processing**
- All outputs must pass automated enhancement (upscale, detail fix, artifact removal).
- There must be no cropping, stretching, or unintended distortions.
- Color correction must follow customer brand guidelines (if any).

## 🎨 2. Visual Quality Acceptance Criteria

### **2.1 Style Consistency**
- Output must match reference style or model style-preset with ≥90% consistency.
- Repeated generations using same seed must produce visually similar results.

### **2.2 Composition & Subject Accuracy**
- The primary subject must appear clearly and be fully visible unless instructed otherwise.
- No major artifacts, warped limbs, random objects, or incorrect text.

### **2.3 Brand & Customer Rules**
- Forbidden colors, patterns, or elements must not appear.
- Output must adhere to customer-specific brand-safe zones (e.g., logo placement area remains unobstructed).

## 🔐 3. Safety & Compliance Acceptance Criteria

### **3.1 Automated Safety Checks**
- Images containing nudity, violence, political content, or copyright risks must be automatically rejected.
- Rejected images must not be saved to the customer history.

### **3.2 Data Protection & Auditability**
- Every generation request must include traceable metadata:  
  `prompt, negative_prompt, model_version, seed, sampler, user_id, timestamp`.

### **3.3 Customer-Specific Compliance Rules**
- HIPAA-related clients → no patient-identifiable visual elements.  
- Pharma clients → no off-label visual implications.  
- Finance/legal clients → no misleading representations.

---

## 🧪 4. QA Acceptance Criteria

### **4.1 Automated QA**
- NSFW detection score < threshold.
- Artifact detection score < threshold.
- Composition score meets preset constraints (centered subject, rule-of-thirds pass).

### **4.2 Manual QA**
- Reviewer confirms style-preset match.
- Reviewer confirms “fit for brand use” based on visual guidelines.
- Reviewer signs off on 3/3 or 4/4 images (depending on batch size).

---

## 🚀 5. Performance & Reliability Acceptance Criteria

### **5.1 Latency**
- 95th percentile request must complete under **15 seconds**.

### **5.2 Stability**
- Pipeline must maintain >99% uptime during POC period.

### **5.3 Reproducibility**
- Same prompt, same seed, same model → variation < 5%.

---

## 📦 6. Delivery & Handoff Acceptance Criteria

- All generated outputs must be available in preview UI.  
- Regenerate/Refine buttons must work with <2s response time.  
- Metadata panel must populate correctly.  
- Customer-facing documentation must be updated.  
- Handover meeting must be completed with Engineering, Design, QA, and CS.

---

## 🎉 7. POC → Pilot → Production Readiness

A feature is considered **production-ready** if:

- All functional + visual + safety criteria above are met  
- All critical issues (P0/P1) resolved  
- No P2 issues affecting customer workflows  
- Logs, dashboards, and alerts configured  
- On-call rotation prepared  
- Customer signs acceptance during Pilot review  

---

## ✔️ Summary

These acceptance criteria ensure the generated images:
- Are **high quality**
- Are **safe**
- Respect **brand & regulatory rules**
- Have **predictable behavior**
- Are **testable**, **verifiable**, and **repeatable**

This is exactly how Enterprise TPMs at Leonardo ensure cross-team alignment.
