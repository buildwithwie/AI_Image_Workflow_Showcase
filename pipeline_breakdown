# Pipeline Breakdown — AI Image Workflow

This document breaks down the image-generation workflow into clear, modular stages.  
Each stage includes its purpose, key decisions, owners, risks, and handoff points — reflecting how a TPM collaborates across engineering, design, and product in an enterprise AI feature delivery.

---

## 🔁 1. Input Acquisition & Pre-Processing
**Purpose**  
Receive user input (text prompt, reference image, constraints) and normalise it for pipeline consistency.

**Key Activities**
- Validate required fields (prompt, resolution, style options)
- Pre-filter unsafe or disallowed content
- Normalise prompt format (remove noise, auto-expand placeholders)
- Associate request with customer profile (brand rules, model presets)

**Owners**
- Product (requirements)
- Engineering (validation logic)
- Content Safety (pre-filters)

**Risks**
- Vague/ambiguous prompts → low-quality outputs  
- Prompt includes disallowed content → compliance breach  

**Deliverables**
- Clean input package ready for sampling

---

## 🧠 2. Prompt Conditioning & Embedding
**Purpose**  
Transform text into model-readable embeddings and apply brand/style constraints.

**Key Activities**
- Convert text prompt → CLIP embeddings  
- Apply custom tokens (brand names, reference styles)  
- Add negative prompts  
- Select model (general SD vs custom finetuned model)  
- Lock seed for reproducibility (optional)

**Owners**
- Engineering (model integration)
- Design / Creative (prompt templates)
- TPM (ensure alignment and test cases)

**Risks**
- Mismatched style tokens → inconsistent output  
- Wrong negative prompts → artifact-heavy images  

**Deliverables**
- Full “prompt package” including embeddings, model choice, guidance scale, seed

---

## 🎨 3. Sampling & Image Generation
**Purpose**  
Produce an initial image based on embeddings, sampling strategy, and model.

**Key Activities**
- Select sampling method (Euler A, DPM++ 2M, etc.)
- Run inference on Automatic1111 / ComfyUI / internal engine
- Generate multiple candidate images (batch)
- Apply initial safety filter

**Owners**
- Engineering (pipeline execution)
- Infra (compute, GPU allocation)

**Risks**
- Latency spikes from heavy models  
- Output variance too high across seeds  
- Compute cost overruns  

**Deliverables**
- Raw image outputs (batch set)

---

## 🔧 4. Post-Processing & Enhancement
**Purpose**  
Improve visual quality and prepare output for QA & client review.

**Key Activities**
- Upscaling (x2–x4)
- Face enhancement / detail fix  
- Artifact removal  
- Color / lighting correction  
- Apply client-specific brand adjustments (if required)

**Owners**
- Engineering
- Design (visual review guidelines)

**Risks**
- Over-enhancement → unnatural look  
- Increased processing cost on large batches  

**Deliverables**
- Enhanced output images ready for validation

---

## 🧪 5. Automated & Manual QA Validation
**Purpose**  
Ensure images meet brand, quality, and safety standards.

**Automated QA Examples**
- NSFW / unsafe detection
- Composition check (subject positioning)
- Color / contrast threshold check
- Text detection (avoid unintended text artifacts)

**Manual QA Examples**
- Brand guideline match  
- Style consistency across batch  
- Visual artifact review  

**Owners**
- QA  
- Design reviewer  
- TPM validates acceptance criteria

**Risks**
- False negatives on automated filters  
- Reviewer subjectivity  

**Deliverables**
- QA report + approved sample set

---

## 📤 6. Delivery, Preview UI, and Feedback Loop
**Purpose**  
Provide outputs to end-users or enterprise clients and capture feedback.

**Key Activities**
- Populate preview UI  
- Allow users to select, regenerate, or refine  
- Capture feedback (rating, comments, request metadata)
- Log prompt/model data for reproducibility

**Owners**
- Frontend engineering  
- Product design  
- TPM ensures tracking events & success metrics

**Risks**
- Unclear UI results in poor client satisfaction  
- Missing tracking → no data for iteration  

**Deliverables**
- User-visible output + feedback dataset

# 📝 Notes
This breakdown reflects how a TPM communicates with engineering, design, QA, and product when coordinating AI-powered features. The emphasis is on sequencing, ownership, dependencies, and risks — not engineering-level implementation.
